# HootHub
A recreation of Kahoot! build in Flutter for the front-end and Firebase for the backend.
## About the project
HootHub is an online platform where players create accounts, make and play Kahoot!-style tests (multiple choice tests). The website contains a search page to look for tests based on metrics (upvotes/downvotes, comments, etc), and players can upvote/downvote and comment on tests.

This project isn't deployed, since it's incomplete, and it would be copying Kahoot!.
### Future features
In the future, I may:
- disable viewing the answers and comments of a test before getting its score
- saving player's scores
- adding MD format to comments
- more player and test statistics
- profile pictures
- images to test answers, among other test features
